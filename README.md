# LiveTAS
DO NOT DOWNLOAD YET - still in testing phase.

LiveTAS is made for windows computers - it will almost certainly not work with other operating systems.

Q: How do I run LiveTAS on my computer?

A: Download the ZIP file of this program from github. Open the file inside it called "publish", and double-click on setup.exe. This will install the program onto your computer.
      You can then open LiveTAS from the start menu whenever you want.


Q: How do I update to the latest version?

A: Follow the steps above to install the latest version of LiveTAS from github. It's as simple as that!


Q: Where can I find the input recordings that LiveTAS has made on my computer?

A: When you first open a new version of LiveTAS, it will ask you to give it a folder on your computer to store its data in.
      From then on, all recordings will be recorded to a folder called Input Sequences in that folder.
      This is also where the program will expect input files to be when it is playing them back.
