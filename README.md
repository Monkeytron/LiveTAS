# LiveTAS
Record, edit and play back a series of key presses and mouse movements.

LiveTAS is a tool for the windows OS that allows you to easily record a series of human inputs, edit the saved file and then play back the edited file.
While it is recording, it will log when a key was pressed, which key was pressed and how long it was held for.

It saves the recorded inputs in a .txt file as an "Input Sequence" - each input is recorded with the time it was pressed at so that they can be played back in the same order.
You can edit this .txt file to add new key presses, change when a key was pressed or how long it was held for, control where the mouse goes at a specific time, ect...

### Word of warning:
As this program is intended to record every key press, **PLEASE** do not type in passwords or sensitive infomation into your computer while you are recording with this program.
I would also recommend that you do not leave your computer unattended while you are playing out an input file. This program takes control of your keyboard and mouse, which could cause problems if you let it loose on your PC.


### FAQs

##### Q: How do I run LiveTAS on my computer?

A: Download the ZIP file of this program from github. Open the file inside it called "publish", and double-click on setup.exe. This will install the program onto your computer.
      You can then open LiveTAS from the start menu whenever you want.



##### Q: How do I update to the latest version?

A: Follow the steps above to install the latest version of LiveTAS from github. It's as simple as that!



##### Q: Where can I find the input recordings that LiveTAS has made on my computer?

A: When you first open a new version of LiveTAS, it will ask you to give it a folder on your computer to store its data in.
      From then on, all recordings will be recorded to a folder called Input Sequences in that folder.
      This is also where the program will expect input files to be when it is playing them back.
      
      
      
##### Q: I want to edit a file of recorded inputs. What does all the writing in it mean?

A: In the same folder as the Input Sequences folder, there should be a file called Instructions.txt . This contains an explanation of the format inputs are recorded in.
      If you still have questions, feel free to ask about it in issues and I'll clarify for you!
